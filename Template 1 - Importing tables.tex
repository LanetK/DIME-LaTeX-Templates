    \section{Introduction} %The titles are created automatically after using this command. This command is also useful as you can create a table of content just by using this. There is no need to do anything extra. 
    
        This template was created to make your life easier. You should be able to create a PDF file with the tables you generated by just editing the path to the files you exported from Stata.
     
    \section{Tables}

   		% To import a table created by iebaltab, just edit the path below to match the location of your file. Remember all file paths must start in the same folder as the main .tex file is (relative file path)
   		\input{../Raw/balance_table.tex}
           	   
         % To import a fragmented tex file -- as created by esttab, for example -- just edit the path after \input
		\begin{table}[H]
			\caption{Add table title}
			\input{../Raw/samplesizes.tex}
		\end{table}
	
		% If your table is too wide and does not fit into page limits, you can we adjust box to make it smaller
		\begin{table}[H]
			\caption{Descriptive statistics for categorical variables}
			\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\textwidth}   
				\input{../Raw/regression_table.tex} %Change the things inside the bracket
			\end{adjustbox}
