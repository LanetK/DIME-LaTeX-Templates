This repository contains resources that will help you make your research more reproducable. This will save you a substantial amount of time, significantly reduce the risk for human errors when exporting results to your papers, and make your research more transparent. We have prepared excercises that will make it easy for you to start using these resources.

# How to get started
## Step 1. Download the material
Click the green ***Clone or Download*** button on this page, then click ***Download ZIP***, and save all the content of this repository to your computer. Then follow the instructions in the handout.

## Step 2. Set up a LaTeX environemnt 
If you already have a LaTeX editor on your computer and you know that is working, skip this step. Otherwise, open the ***How to set up TeXstudio.pdf*** file in the *Set up LaTeX on your computer* folder in the material you downloaded in Step 1. When you have followed those instructions and tested that your set up works correctly, then go the Step 3.

## Step 3. Do Exercises 
In the *Exercises* folder there are subfolders for each excercise. In each fodler you will find a handout file. That file explains how to get started. We receommend that you start with Exercise 1. See a list of all exercises below.

## Step 4. Use the templates in your own reserch 
Feel free to use any of the LaTeX templates in the *DIME Templates* folder for any purpose of your own choice. Please feel free to submit any feedback you might have on how these templates can be improved.

## List of Exercises 

**Excercise 1 - Basic Appendix**
This exercise covers the basics of LaTeX and show you how to create a simple appendix of tables and graphs that automatically updates each time you re-run your code in, for example, Stata and R. At DIME, the Research Assistant create these appendices when producing output for the Economists. When writing the paper or report, these tables and graphs can be kept in the appendix or be moved into the text.

**Excercise 2 - Advanced Appendix (Not created yet)**
This excercise introduces some more advanced techniques to create the appendix, and it also discuss how you can format your tables after they have been exported by a command in, for example, Stata or R.

**Excercise 3 - Full Document  (Not created yet)**
This excercise introduces the topics you need to know to write a full paper or report in LaTeX that dynamically updates when you re-run your code in, for example, Stata and R.

**Excercise Stata - How to export tables and graph from Stata to LaTeX**
This exercise covers how you can use Stata to export tables and grpahs that can be read by LaTeX.

Kristoffer: Mrijan, move this to the instructions for setting up TeXstudio, but I am keeping it here so it is not deleted
## Hello-world.tex
The Hello World file is a .tex file that can be used to check if TeXstudio is properly installed on your computer. To test it, open the file in TeXstudio and click ***Build and View*** in the ***Tools*** menu at the top. If you do not get any error messages (however, you might be asked to install multiple packages the first time you try) and you can see a compiled pdf, then TeXstudio is properly set up for the material in this repository.
