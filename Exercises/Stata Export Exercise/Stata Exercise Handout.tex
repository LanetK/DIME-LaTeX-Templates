\section*{Introduction}
This exercise introduces you to how to export files from Stata that can be read in {\LaTeX}. See exercise 1 and 2 for instructions on how to import file into {\LaTeX}. After this exercise and exercise 1, you will have a document that is automatically updated each time you run your Stata and your {\LaTeX} code.

We have provided you with a do-file that has code that creates file that you can import in a {\LaTeX} document. We will go through these examples and then we will ask you to create some tables and graphs of your own using your own data. Note that this is not an exercise on Stata, only on exporting in {\LaTeX} format from Stata, so this exercise assumes knowledge of some intermediate level Stata commands.

\section*{Part 1: Setting up a Folder Structure}
Do not rush over this part. You will be forced to write an necessarily complicated {\LaTeX} code unless you set up a simple but well organized folder structure for where to export tables and figures from Stata. We strongly recommend that you start by setting up the following folder structure. 

Create one folder called \texttt{Output}, and inside this folder, create a folder called \texttt{Raw}. In the \texttt{Raw} folder you will export tables and graphs from Stata that you will import in your {\LaTeX} document. Your {\LaTeX} document will be saved in the \texttt{Output} folder.

See the example below. As your project grows bigger it is common that sub-folders are added in the \texttt{Raw} folder. For example, tables and figures often have separate folders. You will find your preferred way to organize this.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{img/outputRawFolders}
	\caption{Common Folder Structure}
	\label{fig:pathwin3}
\end{figure} 


\section*{Part 2: Setting your path for Stata}
We now need to tell all commands in Stata to save the tables and figures they export to the \texttt{Raw} folder. We want to create a global with the file path pointing to the \texttt{Raw} folder that we can use in our commands. Using a global instead of typing out the folder location in all commands both makes the code simpler, and makes it easier to update if you would have to move your folders.

Open the do-file \texttt{Export tables and images.do} that you find in the same folder as this handout. Look for the part that says:
\begin{center}
	\verb|global main_folder "<<<ENTER YOUR FOLDER PATH HERE>>>"|
\end{center}

You need to enter the path to the folder you created in part 1. If you have a Windows computer and you created your \texttt{Output} folder in your Documents folder, then your file path should look similar to this:
\begin{center}
	\verb|global main_folder "C:\Users\JoeSmith\Documents\Output"|
\end{center}

The following two sub-sections help you find the file path to the folder you just created if you are not sure how to do that. The first sub-section gives advice for Windows, and the second for Mac.

\subsection*{Finding Path on a Windows Computer}

Path to a file can be found by selecting a file and pressing {\color{red}SHIFT on your keyboard and RIGHT CLICKING your mouse and then clicking COPY AS PATH in the resulting drop down menu} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pathwin3}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/pathwin3}
	\caption{Finding path on a Windows Computer - Solution 1}
	\label{fig:pathwin3}
\end{figure}


Another solution to finding the path on a Windows computer is shown in Annex 1.
	
\subsection*{Finding Path on a Mac}


\section*{Part 3: File Formats and Names}
Not all file formats that you can chose when exporting from Stata is valid to import into {\LaTeX}. Figures must be saved in \texttt{.png} format. All figures produced in Stata can be exported in \texttt{.png}. Even if some commands are not able to export in this format, you can use Stata to convert the figure for you. You will find more details on this in the parts below where we export figures. 

Tables must be saved in \texttt{.tex} format. Tables cannot be converted as easily as figures, so it is usually easier to find an alternative command that produces the same table but can export to \texttt{.tex} format. Most commands that export tables are able to export to this format so it should not be difficult to find an alternative.

Files exported in for example \texttt{MS Word} or \texttt{MS Excel} or in Stata's \texttt{.gph} format are not valid to import to {\LaTeX}.

Files exported from Stata should have a descriptive name. Otherwise you increase the risk for human errors, and the whole point of dynamic documents is to reduce exactly that. For example - rather than \texttt{graph1.png}, \texttt{graph2.tex}, names like \texttt{treatmentEffectGraph.png} would make it easier to understand what files we are using.

\section*{Part 4, Task 1: Tabulate Categorical Variables}

While exporting summary statistics table using \texttt{esttab}, \verb|using 	"$raw_output/categorical.tex", replace| should always include an explanatory file name and also the {\LaTeX} extension \texttt{.tex}.

\section*{Part 4, Task 2: Regression table}

Similar to Part 1, Task 1, while using \texttt{esttab} to export regression tables, the \verb|using "$raw_output/regression_table.tex"| part should include an explanatory file name(in this case \texttt{regression\_table.tex}) and should also have the {\LaTeX} file extension \texttt{.tex}.

\section*{Part 5, Task 1: Using \texttt{iegraph} to create a figure}

%Mirjan: Hightlight the difference between these two tasks in part 5. We are not making it easy for the user to match the main point of having these two differences.

% Elaborate a bit more on the .png point

This exercise teaches how to use \texttt{iegraph} to create a figure and export it to the graphs folder. 


Using the \verb|save("$raw_output/iegraph.png")| ensures that the graphs are directly saved to the specified output folder. 

\section*{Part 5, Task 2: Manually Create a Graph and then Export it}

This task shows us how to export graphs created in Stata to export in a format that {\LaTeX} can read. Stata's save graph feature saves the graph in \texttt{.gph} format which only Stata can read. However, the \texttt{graph export}  feature  saves the graph in a picture format i.e. png format which can be read by not only Stata but the picture viewer on your computer, phone and also {\LaTeX}. It is \emph{absolutely critical} to export the graph in this format, so that {\LaTeX} can import it. 

Using the \verb|graph export "$raw_output/regular_graph.png", width(5000) replace| 
exports the graph in png format which {\LaTeX} can read.

\textit{Note: This is different from the \texttt{iegraph} command where save can both export the graph in \texttt{.gph} and \texttt{.png} format. For Stata's twoway graph command, export has be to be used to make it readable in {\LaTeX}}. 

\section*{Part 6: Making a Dynamic Document \\ \hfill Using a do-file to edit a .tex file after exporting it}

%Mrijan. Use this exercise to show that the tables updates automatically. But walk the user through that step by step. Ask teh user to have completed exercise 1 first. And do not use any termonology not inclided there already.



During this part of the exercise, you will learn how to use commands in Stata to format your tables. While tables exported from Stata to {\LaTeX} are generally very nice, sometimes they need to be tweaked a little to make them look nicer. So, in this exercise, you'll use the \texttt{filefilter} command in Stata to make small changes to the files exported by Stata.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pathwin}, left clicking(normal click) on the bar at the top of the \texttt{File Explorer} windows where our files are saved shows us the complete path to the files in a Windows computer. \\

\end{figure}

We can see in Figure \ref{fig:pathwin2}, that the complete path to the folder is shown. We can then paste this path when setting the path in our Stata do-file and changing the path where it says \begin{verbatim}
global main_folder ``<<<ENTER YOUR FOLDER PATH HERE>>>''
\end{verbatim}
