	This exercise

\section*{Exercise 2. Exporting tables}
Open \textcolor{red}{Export tables and images.do} and change the paths on the first section of the do-file so that it matches the folder structure you just created. Then run the do-file. This will export a few tables and graphs to the Raw folder that will be used in the following exercises. If you want to take a step back and review how to export tables and images from Stata, the a look at the folder called "Excercise Stata - How to export tables and graph from Stata to LaTeX".

\section*{Exercise 8. (CHALLENGE) Using a do-file to edit a .tex file after exporting it}

This exercise requires more familiarity with {\LaTeX} than the previous. Don't worry if you can't complete it. \\

\textbf{Task 1:} Run the initial code for exercise 6 in the \textcolor{red}{Add path and name of do-file} do-file. This will create a table with sample sizes for control and treatment groups across regions and in the whole sample. Add this table to the .tex file you created in the previous exercises. How does that look?\\

\textbf{Task 2:} Open the \textcolor{red}{Add path and name of tex file} .tex file created by Stata. Can you identify the source of the extra spacing?\\

\textbf{Task 3:} Use the \texttt{filefilter} command in Stata to filter out the lines or characters in the fragmented file that create the extra spacing. Import the new .tex file and check how it looks.\\

\textbf{Task 4:} Repeat task 3 if necessary.
