    \section{Introduction} %The titles are created automatically after using this command. This command is also useful as you can create a table of content just by using this. There is no need to do anything extra. 
    
        This template was created to make your life easier. You should be able to create a PDF file with the figures you generated by just editing the path to the files you exported from Stata.
     
    \section{Figures}
           	   
         % Edit the path after \includegraphics to match the location of your figure. You can also edit the figure size by using [width=\linewidth]. Typing .5 \linewidth before will reduce it to half the size, and typing .8 to 80% and so on.
